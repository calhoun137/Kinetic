Kinetic
=============

http://calhoun137.github.io/Kinetic

Kinetic is a java script game engine that functions essentially as a wrapper around box2d, and it makes use of the excellent port box2dweb.js.  The source code was written with the goal of doing a lot with a little, and I believe the code is simple enough that it can serve as a solid introduction to the fundamentals of game engines for a motivated person who knows only a bit of java script.

Kinetic is a java script game engine that functions essentially as a wrapper around box2d, and it makes use of the excellent port box2dweb.js.  The source code was written with the goal of doing a lot with a little, and it can serve as an introduction to the fundamentals of game engines for a motivated person who knows a bit of java script.
